2025-08-24 21:04:35,529 - GenAIApp - INFO - Final response sent to user: Generated response to: Explain quantum computing in simple terms. is  : Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum mechanics to process information. In traditional computers, information is represented in bits, which can be either a 0 or a 1. In quantum computers, information is represented in quantum bits, or qubits, which can be both a 0 and a 1 at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform calculations much faster and more efficiently than traditional computers. Quantum computing has the potential to solve complex problems that are currently impossible for traditional computers to solve.
