This ency-\\nclopedia avoids medical jargon and uses language that\\nlaypersons can understand, while still providing thor-\\nough coverage of each topic. The Gale Encyclopedia of\\nMedicine 2 fills a gap between basic consumer health\\nresources, such as single-volume family medical guides,\\nand highly technical professional materials.\\nSCOPE\\nAlmost 1,700 full-length articles are included in the\\nGale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 , including disorders/\\nconditions, tests/procedures, and treatments/therapies.\\nMany common drugs are also covered, with generic drug\\nnames appearing first and brand names following in\\nparentheses, eg. acetaminophen (Tylenol). Throughout\\nthe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 , many prominent\\nindividuals are highlighted as sidebar biographies that\\naccompany the main topical essays. Articles follow a\\nstandardized format that provides information at a\\nglance.

Aimed at achieving and main-\\ntaining good health rather than just eliminating disease,this approach has come to be known as alternative medi-\\ncine. The Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 includes a\\nnumber of essays on alternative therapies, ranging from\\ntraditional Chinese medicine to homeopathy and from\\nmeditation to aromatherapy. In addition to full essays on\\nalternative therapies, the encyclopedia features specific\\nAlternative treatment sections for diseases and condi-\\ntions that may be helped by complementary therapies.\\nINCLUSION CRITERIA\\nA preliminary list of diseases, disorders, tests and treat-\\nments was compiled from a wide variety of sources,\\nincluding professional medical guides and textbooks as\\nwell as consumer guides and encyclopedias. The general\\nadvisory board, made up of public librarians, medical\\nlibrarians and consumer health experts, evaluated the top-\\nics and made suggestions for inclusion. The list was sorted\\nby category and sent to GEM2 medical advisors, certified\\nphysicians with various medical specialities, for review.\\nFinal selection of topics to include was made by the med-\\nical advisors in conjunction with the Gale Group editor.\\nABOUT THE CONTRIBUTORS\\nThe essays were compiled by experienced medical\\nwriters, including physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and\\nother health care professionals. GEM2 medical advisors\\nreviewed the completed essays to insure that they are\\nappropriate, up-to-date, and medically accurate.\\nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK\\nThe Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine 2 has been\\ndesigned with ready reference in mind.\\n• Straight alphabetical arrangement allows users to\\nlocate information quickly.\\n• Bold-faced terms function as print hyperlinks that\\npoint the reader to related entries in the encyclopedia.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 IXINTRODUCTION'),\n",

Combined with certain pain\\nrelievers or medicines for treating migraine headache ,\\ncaffeine makes those drugs work more quickly and effec-\\ntively. Caffeine alone can also help relieve headaches.\\nAntihistamines are sometimes combined with caffeine\\nto counteract the drowsiness that those drugs cause. Caf-\\nfeine is also sometimes used to treat other conditions,\\nincluding breathing problems in newborns and in young\\nbabies after surgery.\\nDescription\\nCaffeine is found naturally in coffee, tea, and chocolate.\\nColas and some other soft drinks contain it. Caffeine also\\ncomes in tablet and capsule forms and can be bought without\\na prescription. Over-the-counter caffeine brands include No\\nDoz, Overtime, Pep-Back, Quick-Pep, Caffedrine, and\\nVivarin. Some pain relievers, medicines for migraine\\nheadaches, and antihistamines also contain caffeine.\\nRecommended dosage\\nAdults and children age 12 years and over\\n100–200 mg no more than every 3–4 hours. In\\ntimed-release form, the dose is 200–250 mg once a day.Timed-release forms should not be taken less than six\\nhours before bedtime.\\nChildren under 12 years\\nNot recommended.\\nOther considerations\\nAvoid taking too much caffeine when it is being\\ntaken as an over-the-counter drug. Consider how much\\ncaffeine is being taken in from coffee, tea, chocolate, soft\\ndrinks, and other foods that contain caffeine. Check with\\na pharmacist or physician to find out how much caffeine\\nis safe to use.\\nPrecautions\\nCaffeine cannot replace sleep and should not be used\\nregularly to stay awake as the drug can lead to more seri-\\nous sleep disorders , like insomnia .\\nPeople who use large amounts of caffeine over long\\nperiods build up a tolerance to it. When that happens,\\nthey have to use more and more caffeine to get the same\\neffects. Heavy caffeine use can also lead to dependence.\\nIf the person then stops using caffeine abruptly, with-\\ndrawal symptoms may occur. These can include throb-\\nbing headaches, fatigue , drowsiness, yawning, irritabili-\\nty, restlessness, vomiting, or runny nose. These symp-\\ntoms can go on for as long as a week if caffeine is avoid-\\ned. Then the symptoms usually disappear.\\nIf taken too close to bedtime, caffeine can interfere\\nwith sleep. Even if it does not prevent a person from\\nfalling asleep, it may disturb sleep during the night.\\nThe notion that caffeine helps people sober up after\\ndrinking too much alcohol is a myth. In fact, using caf-\\nfeine and alcohol together is not a good idea. The combi-\\nnation can lead to an upset stomach, nausea, and vomiting.\\nOlder people may be more sensitive to caffeine and\\nthus more likely to have certain side effects, such as irri-\\ntability, nervousness, anxiety , and sleep problems.C\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 625'),\n",

Caffeine can pass from a pregnant\\nwoman’s body into the developing fetus. Although there\\nis no evidence that caffeine causes birth defects in peo-\\nple, it does cause such effects in laboratory animals given\\nvery large doses (equal to human doses of 12–24 cups of\\ncoffee a day). In humans, evidence exists that doses of\\nmore than 300 mg of caffeine a day (about the amount of\\ncaffeine in 2–3 cups of coffee) may cause miscarriage or\\nproblems with the baby’s heart rhythm. Women who take\\nmore than 300 mg of caffeine a day during pregnancy\\nare also more likely to have babies with low birth\\nweights. Any woman who is pregnant or planning to\\nbecome pregnant should check with her physician before\\nusing caffeine.\\nBREASTFEEDING. Caffeine passes into breast milk\\nand can affect the nursing baby. Nursing babies whose\\nmothers use 600 mg or more of caffeine a day may be\\nirritable and have trouble sleeping.

Using caffeine with\\ncertain other drugs may interfere with the effects of the\\ndrugs or cause unwanted—and possibly serious—side\\neffects.\\nSide effects\\nAt recommended doses, caffeine can cause restless-\\nness, irritability, nervousness, shakiness, headache , light-\\nheadedness, sleeplessness, nausea, vomiting, and upset\\nstomach. At higher than recommended doses, caffeine can\\ncause excitement, agitation, anxiety, confusion, a sensa-\\ntion of light flashing before the eyes, unusual sensitivity to\\ntouch, unusual sensitivity of other senses, ringing in the\\nears, frequent urination, muscle twitches or tremors , heart\\narrhythmias, rapid heartbeat, flushing, and convulsions.\\nInteractions\\nCertain drugs interfere with the breakdown of caf-\\nfeine in the body. These include oral contraceptives that\\ncontain estrogen, the antiarrhythmia drug mexiletine\\n(Mexitil), the ulcer drug cimetidine (Tagamet), and the\\ndrug disulfiram (Antabuse), used to treat alcoholism .\\nCaffeine interferes with drugs that regulate heart\\nrhythm, such as quinidine and propranolol (Inderal). Caf-\\nfeine may also interfere with the body’s absorption of iron.\\nAnyone who takes iron supplements should take them at\\nleast an hour before or two hours after using caffeine.\\nSerious side effects are possible when caffeine is\\ncombined with certain drugs. For example, taking caf-\\nfeine with the decongestant phenylpropanolamine can\\nraise blood pressure. And very serious heart problems\\nmay occur if caffeine and monoamine oxidase\\ninhibitors (MAO) are taken together. These drugs are\\nused to treat Parkinson’s disease , depression, and other\\npsychiatric conditions. Consult with a pharmacist or\\nphysician about which drugs can interact with caffeine.\\nBecause caffeine stimulates the nervous system,\\nanyone taking other central nervous system (CNS) stim-\\nulants should be careful about using caffeine.\\nNancy Ross-Flanigan\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 626Caffeine'),\n",

However, some mutant cells may\\nescape immune detection and survive to become tumors\\nor cancers.\\nTumors are of two types, benign or malignant. A\\nbenign tumor is not considered cancer. It is slow growing,\\ndoes not spread or invade surrounding tissue, and once it\\nis removed, it doesn’t usually recur. A malignant tumor,\\non the other hand, is cancer. It invades surrounding tissue\\nand spreads to other parts of the body. If the cancer cells\\nhave spread to the surrounding tissues, then, even after\\nthe malignant tumor is removed, it generally recurs.\\nA majority of cancers are caused by changes in the\\ncell’s DNA because of damage due to the environment.\\nEnvironmental factors that are responsible for causing\\nthe initial mutation in the DNA are called carcinogens,\\nand there are many types.\\nThere are some cancers that have a genetic basis. In\\nother words, an individual could inherit faulty DNA from\\nhis parents, which could predispose him to getting cancer.\\nWhile there is scientific evidence that both factors (envi-\\nronmental and genetic) play a role, less than 10% of all\\ncancers are purely hereditary. Cancers that are known to\\nhave a hereditary link are breast cancer, colon cancer,\\novarian cancer , and uterine cancer. Besides genes, cer-\\ntain physiological traits could be inherited and could con-\\ntribute to cancers. For example, inheriting fair skin makes\\na person more likely to develop skin cancer, but only if\\nthey also have prolonged exposure to intensive sunlight.\\nThere are several different types of cancers:\\n• Carcinomas are cancers that arise in the epithelium (the\\nlayers of cells covering the body’s surface and lining the\\ninternal organs and various glands). Ninety percent of\\nhuman cancers fall into this category. Carcinomas can besubdivided into two types: adenocarcinomas and squa-\\nmous cell carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that\\ndevelop in an organ or a gland, while squamous cell car-\\ncinomas refer to cancers that originate in the skin.\\n• Melanomas also originate in the skin, usually in the\\npigment cells (melanocytes).\\n• Sarcomas are cancers of the supporting tissues of the\\nbody, such as bone, muscle and blood vessels.\\n• Cancers of the blood and lymph glands are called\\nleukemias and lymphomas respectively.\\n• Gliomas are cancers of the nerve tissue.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe major risk factors for cancer are: tobacco, alco-\\nhol, diet, sexual and reproductive behavior, infectious\\nagents, family history, occupation, environment and pol-\\nlution.\\nAccording to the estimates of the American Cancer\\nSociety (ACS), approximately 40% of the cancer deaths\\nin 1998 will be due to tobacco and excessive alcohol use.\\nAn additional one-third of the deaths will be related to\\ndiet and nutrition . Many of the one million skin cancers\\nthat are expected to be diagnosed in 1998 will be due to\\nover-exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun’s rays.\\nTobacco\\nEighty to ninety percent of the lung cancer cases\\noccur in smokers. Smoking has also been shown to be a\\ncontributory factor in cancers of upper respiratory tract,\\nesophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, and probably liver,\\nstomach, and kidney as well. Recently, scientists have\\nalso shown that second-hand smoke (or passive smoking)\\ncan increase one’s risk of developing cancer.\\nAlcohol\\nExcessive consumption of alcohol is a risk factor in\\ncertain cancers, such as liver cancer . Alcohol, in combi-\\nnation with tobacco, significantly increases the chances\\nthat an individual will develop mouth, pharynx, larynx\\nand esophageal cancers.\\nDiet\\nThirty-five percent of all cancers are due to dietary\\ncauses. Excessive intake of fat leading to obesity has\\nbeen associated with cancers of the breast, colon, rectum,\\npancreas, prostate, gall bladder, ovaries and uterus.\\nSexual and reproductive behavior\\nThe human papilloma virus, which is sexually trans-\\nmitted, has been shown to cause cancer of the cervix.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 632Cancer'),\n",

In addition, it has also been\\nshown that women who don’t have children or have chil-\\ndren late in life have an increased risk for both ovarian\\nand breast cancer.\\nInfectious agents\\nIn the last 20 years, scientists have obtained evidence\\nto show that approximately 15% of the world’s cancer\\ndeaths can be traced to viruses, bacteria, or parasites. The\\nmost common cancer-causing pathogens and the cancers\\nassociated with them are shown in table form.\\nFamily history\\nCertain cancers like breast, colon, ovarian and uter-\\nine cancer recur generation after generation in some fami-\\nlies. A few cancers, such as the eye cancer “retinoblas-\\ntoma,” a type of colon cancer, and a type of breast cancer\\nknown as “early-onset breast cancer,” have been shown to\\nbe linked to certain genes that can be tracked within a\\nfamily. It is therefore possible that inheriting particular\\ngenes makes a person susceptible to certain cancers.\\nOccupational hazards\\nThere is evidence to prove that certain occupational\\nhazards account for 4% of all cancer deaths. For exam-\\nple, asbestos workers have an increased incidence of\\nlung cancer. Similarly, a higher likelihood of getting\\nbladder cancer is associated with dye, rubber and gas\\nworkers; skin and lung cancer with smelters, gold miners\\nand arsenic workers; leukemia with glue and varnish\\nworkers; liver cancer with PVC manufacturers; and lung,\\nbone and bone marrow cancer with radiologists and ura-\\nnium miners.\\nEnvironment\\nRadiation is believed to cause 1–2% of all cancer\\ndeaths. Ultra-violet radiation from the sun accounts for a\\nmajority of melanoma deaths. Other sources of radiation\\nare x rays, radon gas, and ionizing radiation from nuclear\\nmaterial.\\nPollution\\nSeveral studies have shown that there is a well-\\nestablished link between asbestos and cancer. Chlorina-\\ntion of water may account for a small rise in cancer risk.\\nHowever, the main danger from pollution occurs when\\ndangerous chemicals from the industries escape into the\\nsurrounding environment. It has been estimated that 1%\\nof cancer deaths are due to air, land and water pollution.Cancer is a progressive disease, and goes through sev-\\neral stages. Each stage may produce a number of symp-\\ntoms. Some symptoms are produced early and may occur\\ndue to a tumor that is growing within an organ or a gland.\\nAs the tumor grows, it may press on the nearby nerves,\\norgans and blood vessels. This causes pain and some pres-\\nsure which may be the earliest warning signs of cancer.\\nDespite the fact that there are several hundred differ-\\nent types of cancers, producing very different symptoms,\\nthe ACS has established the following seven symptoms\\nas possible warning signals of cancer:\\n• changes in the size, color, or shape of a wart or a mole\\n• a sore that does not heal\\n• persistent cough , hoarseness, or sore throat\\n• a lump or thickening in the breast or elsewhere\\n• unusual bleeding or discharge\\n• chronic indigestion or difficulty in swallowing\\n• any change in bowel or bladder habits\\nMany other diseases, besides cancer, could produce\\nthe same symptoms. However, it is important to have\\nthese symptoms checked, as soon as possible, especially\\nif they linger. The earlier a cancer is diagnosed and treat-\\ned, the better the chance of it being cured. Many cancers\\nsuch as breast cancer may not have any early symptoms.\\nTherefore, it is important to undergo routine screening\\ntests such as breast self-exams and mammograms.\\nDiagnosis\\nDiagnosis begins with a thorough physical examina-\\ntion and a complete medical history. The doctor will\\nobserve, feel and palpate (apply pressure by touch) differ-\\nent parts of the body in order to identify any variations\\nfrom the normal size, feel and texture of the organ or tissue.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 633Cancer\\nFrequency Of Cancer-Related Death\\nCancer Site Number of Deaths Per Year\\nLung 160,100\\nColon and rectum 56,500\\nBreast 43,900\\nProstate 39,200\\nPancreas 28,900\\nLymphoma 26,300\\nLeukemia 21,600\\nBrain 17,400\\nStomach 13,700\\nLiver 13,000\\nEsophagus 11,900\\nBladder 12,500\\nKidney 11,600\\nMultiple myeloma 11,300'),\n",

By focusing a light into the\\nmouth, he will look for abnormalities in color, moisture,\\nsurface texture, or presence of any thickening or sore in the\\nlips, tongue, gums, the hard palate on the roof of the mouth,\\nand the throat. To detect thyroid cancer , the doctor will\\nobserve the front of the neck for swelling. He may gently\\nmanipulate the neck and palpate the front and side surfaces\\nof the thyroid gland (located at the base of the neck) to\\ndetect any nodules or tenderness. As part of the physical\\nexamination, the doctor will also palpate the lymph nodes\\nin the neck, under the arms and in the groin. Many illnesses\\nand cancers cause a swelling of the lymph nodes.\\nThe doctor may conduct a thorough examination of\\nthe skin to look for sores that have been present for more\\nthan three weeks and that bleed, ooze, or crust; irritated\\npatches that may itch or hurt, and any change in the size\\nof a wart or a mole.\\nExamination of the female pelvis is used to detect\\ncancers of the ovaries, uterus, cervix, and vagina. In the\\nvisual examination, the doctor looks for abnormal dis-\\ncharges or the presence of sores. Then, using gloved\\nhands the physician palpates the internal pelvic organs\\nsuch as the uterus and ovaries to detect any abnormal\\nmasses. Breast examination includes visual observation\\nwhere the doctor looks for any discharge, unevenness,\\ndiscoloration, or scaling. The doctor palpates both\\nbreasts to feel for masses or lumps.\\nFor males, inspection of the rectum and the prostate\\nis also included in the physical examination. The doctor\\ninserts a gloved finger into the rectum and rotates it slow-\\nly to feel for any growths, tumors, or other abnormalities.\\nThe doctor also conducts an examination of the testes,\\nwhere the doctor observes the genital area and looks for\\nswelling or other abnormalities. The testicles are palpat-\\ned to identify any lumps, thickening or differences in the\\nsize, weight and firmness.\\nIf the doctor detects an abnormality on physical exam-\\nination, or the patient has some symptom that could be\\nindicative of cancer, the doctor may order diagnostic tests.\\nLaboratory studies of sputum (sputum cytology),\\nblood, urine, and stool can detect abnormalities that may\\nindicate cancer. Sputum cytology is a test where the\\nphlegm that is coughed up from the lungs is microscopi-\\ncally examined. It is often used to detect lung cancer. A\\nblood test for cancer is easy to perform, usually inexpen-\\nsive and risk-free. The blood sample is obtained by a lab\\ntechnician or a doctor by inserting a needle into a vein\\nand is relatively painless. Blood tests can be either spe-\\ncific or non-specific. Often times, in certain cancers, the\\ncancer cells release particular proteins (called tumor\\nmarkers ) and blood tests can be used to detect the pres-ence of these tumor markers. However, with a few excep-\\ntions, tumor markers are not used for routine screening\\nof cancers, because several non-cancerous conditions\\nalso produce positive results. Blood tests are generally\\nmore useful in monitoring the effectiveness of the treat-\\nment, or in following the course of the disease and\\ndetecting recurrent disease.\\nImaging tests such as computed tomography scans\\n(CT scans), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultra-\\nsound and fiberoptic scope examinations help the doctors\\ndetermine the location of the tumor even if it is deep\\nwithin the body. Conventional x rays are often used for\\ninitial evaluation, because they are relatively cheap, pain-\\nless and easily accessible. In order to increase the infor-\\nmation obtained from a conventional x ray, air or a dye\\n(such as barium or iodine) may be used as a contrast\\nmedium to outline or highlight parts of the body.\\nThe most definitive diagnostic test is the biopsy,\\nwherein a piece of tissue is surgically removed for micro-\\nscope examination. Besides confirming a cancer, the\\nbiopsy also provides information about the type of can-\\ncer, the stage it has reached, the aggressiveness of the\\ncancer and the extent of its spread. Since a biopsy pro-\\nvides the most accurate analysis, it is considered the gold\\nstandard of diagnostic tests.\\nScreening examinations conducted regularly by\\nhealthcare professionals can result in the detection of can-\\ncers of the breast, colon, rectum, cervix, prostate, testis,\\ntongue, mouth, and skin at early stages, when treatment is\\nmore likely to be successful. Some of the routine screen-\\ning tests recommended by the ACS are sigmoidoscopy\\n(for colorectal cancer), mammography (for breast can-\\ncer), pap smear (for cervical cancer ), and the PSA test\\n(for prostate cancer). Self-examinations for cancers of the\\nbreast, testes, mouth, and skin can also help in detecting\\nthe tumors before the symptoms become serious.\\nA recent revolution in molecular biology and cancer\\ngenetics has contributed a great deal to the development\\nof several tests designed to assess one’s risk of getting\\ncancers. These new techniques include genetic testing ,\\nwhere molecular probes are used to identify mutations in\\ncertain genes that have been linked to particular cancers.\\nAt present, however, there are a lot of limitations to genet-\\nic testing and its utility appears ambiguous, emphasizing\\nthe need to develop better strategies for early detection.\\nTreatment\\nThe aim of cancer treatment is to remove all or as\\nmuch of the tumor as possible and to prevent the recur-\\nrence or spread of the primary tumor.

If the cancer is very aggressive and a cure is\\nnot possible, then the treatment should be aimed at\\nrelieving the symptoms and controlling the cancer for as\\nlong as possible.\\nCancer treatment can take many different forms, and\\nit is always tailored to the individual patient. The deci-\\nsion on which type of treatment is the most appropriate\\ndepends on the type and location of cancer, the extent to\\nwhich it has already spread, the patient’s age, sex, gener-\\nal health status and personal treatment preferences. The\\nmajor types of treatment are: surgery, radiation, chemo-\\ntherapy , immunotherapy, hormone therapy, and bone-\\nmarrow transplantation.\\nSurgery\\nSurgery is the removal of a visible tumor and is the\\nmost frequently used cancer treatment. It is most effec-\\ntive when a cancer is small and confined to one area of\\nthe body.\\nSurgery can be used for many purposes.\\n• Treatment. Treatment of cancer by surgery involves\\nremoval of the tumor to cure the disease. This is typical-\\nly done when the cancer is localized to a discrete area.\\nAlong with the cancer, some part of the normal sur-\\nrounding tissue is also removed to ensure that no cancer\\ncells remain in the area. Since cancer usually spreads\\nvia the lymphatic system, adjoining lymph nodes may\\nbe examined and sometimes they are removed as well.\\n• Preventive surgery. Preventive or prophylactic surgery\\ninvolves removal of an abnormal looking area that is\\nlikely to become malignant over time. For example,\\n40% of the people with a colon disease known as ulcer-\\native colitis , ultimately die of colon cancer. Rather than\\nlive with the fear of developing colon cancer, these peo-\\nple may choose to have their colons removed and\\nreduce the risk significantly.• Diagnostic purposes. The most definitive tool for diag-\\nnosing cancer is a biopsy. Sometimes, a biopsy can be\\nperformed by inserting a needle through the skin. How-\\never, at other times, the only way to obtain some tissue\\nsample for biopsy is by performing a surgical operation.\\n• Cytoreductive surgery is a procedure where the doctor\\nremoves as much of the cancer as possible, and then\\ntreats the remaining with radiation therapy or chemo-\\ntherapy or both.\\n• Palliative surgery is aimed at curing the symptoms, not\\nthe cancer. Usually, in such cases, the tumor is so large or\\nhas spread so much that removing the entire tumor is not\\nan option. For example, a tumor in the abdomen may be\\nso large that it may press on and block a portion of the\\nintestine, interfering with digestion and causing pain and\\nvomiting. “Debulking surgery” may remove a part of the\\nblockage and relieve the symptoms. In tumors that are\\ndependent on hormones, removal of the organs that\\nsecrete the hormones is an option. For example, in\\nprostate cancer, the release of testosterone by the testi-\\ncles stimulates the growth of cancerous cells. Hence, a\\nman may undergo an “orchiectomy” (removal of testi-\\ncles) to slow the progress of the disease. Similarly, in a\\ntype of aggressive breast cancer, removal of the ovaries\\n(oophorectomy ) will stop the synthesis of hormones\\nfrom the ovaries and slow the progression of the cancer.\\nRadiation\\nRadiation kills tumor cells. Radiation is used alone\\nin cases where a tumor is unsuitable for surgery. More\\noften, it is used in conjunction with surgery and\\nchemotherapy. Radiation can be either external or inter-\\nnal. In the external form, the radiation is aimed at the\\ntumor from outside the body. In internal radiation (also\\nknown as brachytherapy), a radioactive substance in the\\nform of pellets or liquid is placed at the cancerous site\\nby means of a pill, injection or insertion in a sealed con-\\ntainer.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 635Cancer\\nCommon Pathogens And The Cancers Associated With Them\\nCausative Angent Type of Cancer\\nViruses\\nPapillomaviruses Cancer of the cervix\\nHepatitis B virus Liver cancer\\nHepatitis C virus Liver cancer\\nEpstein-Barr virus Burkitt’s lymphoma\\nCancers of the upper pharynx Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Gastric cancers\\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) Kaposi’s sarcoma lymphoma\\nBacteria\\nHelicobacter pylori Stomach cancer lymphomas'),\n",

Chemotherapeutic\\ndrugs can be taken either orally (by mouth) or intra-\\nvenously, and may be given alone or in conjunction with\\nsurgery, radiation or both.\\nWhen chemotherapy is used before surgery or radia-\\ntion, it is known as primary chemotherapy or “neoadju-\\nvant chemotherapy.” An advantage of neoadjuvant\\nchemotherapy is that since the cancer cells have not been\\nexposed to anti-cancer drugs, they are especially vulnera-\\nble. It can therefore be used effectively to reduce the size\\nof the tumor for surgery or target it for radiation. Howev-\\ner, the toxic effects of neoadjuvant chemotherapy are\\nsevere. In addition, it may make the body less tolerant to\\nthe side effects of other treatments that follow such as\\nradiation therapy. The more common use of chemothera-\\npy is adjuvant therapy, which is given to enhance the\\neffectiveness of other treatments For example, after\\nsurgery, adjuvant chemotherapy is given to destroy any\\ncancerous cells that still remain in the body.\\nImmunotherapy\\nImmunotherapy uses the body’s own immune sys-\\ntem to destroy cancer cells. This form of treatment is\\nbeing intensively studied in clinical trials and is not yet\\nwidely available to most cancer patients. The various\\nimmunological agents being tested include substances\\nproduced by the body (such as the interferons, inter-\\nleukins, and growth factors), monoclonal antibodies and\\nvaccines. Unlike traditional vaccines, cancer vaccines do\\nnot prevent cancer. Instead, they are designed to treat\\npeople who already have the disease. Cancer vaccines\\nwork by boosting the body’s immune system and training\\nthe immune cells to specifically destroy cancer cells.\\nHormone therapy\\nHormone therapy is standard treatment for some\\ntypes of cancers that are hormone-dependent and grow\\nfaster in the presence of particular hormones. These\\ninclude cancer of the prostate, breast, and uterus. Hor-\\nmone therapy involves blocking the production or action\\nof these hormones. As a result the growth of the tumor\\nslows down and survival may be extended for several\\nmonths or years.\\nBone marrow transplantation\\nThe bone marrow is the tissue within the bone cavi-\\nties that contains blood-forming cells. Healthy bone\\nmarrow tissue constantly replenishes the blood supplyand is essential to life. Sometimes, the amount of drugs\\nor radiation needed to destroy cancer cells also destroys\\nbone marrow. Replacing the bone marrow with healthy\\ncells counteracts this adverse effect. A bone marrow\\ntransplant is the removal of marrow from one person and\\nthe transplant of the blood-forming cells either to the\\nsame person or to someone else. Bone-marrow trans-\\nplantation, while not a therapy in itself, is often used to\\n“rescue” a patient, by allowing those with cancer to\\nundergo very aggressive therapy.\\nMany different specialists generally work together\\nas a team to treat cancer patients. An oncologist is a\\nphysician who specializes in cancer care. The oncologist\\nprovides chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and any other\\nnon-surgical treatment that does not involve radiation.\\nThe oncologist often serves as the primary physician and\\ncoordinates the patient’s treatment plan.\\nThe radiation oncologist specializes in using radia-\\ntion to treat cancer, while the surgical oncologist performs\\nthe operations needed to diagnose or treat cancer. Gyne-\\ncologist-oncologists and pediatric-oncologists, as their\\ntitles suggest, are physicians involved with treating\\nwomen’s and children’s cancers respectively. Many other\\nspecialists may also be involved in the care of a cancer\\npatient. For example, radiologists specialize in the use of\\nx rays, ultrasounds, computed tomography scans (CT\\nscans), MRI imaging and other techniques that are used to\\ndiagnose cancer. Hematologists specialize in disorders of\\nthe blood and are consulted in case of blood cancers and\\nbone marrow cancers. The samples that are removed for\\nbiopsy are sent to a laboratory, where a pathologist exam-\\nines them to determine the type of cancer and extent of\\nthe disease. Only some of the specialists who are involved\\nwith cancer care have been mentioned above. There are\\nmany other specialties, and virtually any type of medical\\nor surgical specialist may become involved with care of\\nthe cancer patient should it become necessary.\\nAlternative treatment\\nThere are a multitude of alternative treatments avail-\\nable to help the person with cancer. They can be used in\\nconjunction with, or separate from, surgery, chemothera-\\npy, and radiation therapy. Alternative treatment of cancer\\nis a complicated arena and a trained health practitioner\\nshould be consulted.\\nAlthough the effectiveness of complementary thera-\\npies such as acupuncture in alleviating cancer pain has\\nnot been clinically proven, many cancer patients find it\\nsafe and beneficial.

However, isolation of the individual constituent\\nof vegetables and fruits that are anti-cancer agents has\\nproven difficult. In laboratory studies, vitamins such as\\nA, C and E, as well as compounds such as isothio-\\ncyanates and dithiolthiones found in broccoli, cauli-\\nflower, and cabbage, and beta-carotene found in carrots\\nhave been shown to protect against cancer. Studies have\\nshown that eating a diet rich in fiber as found in fruits\\nand vegetables reduces the risk of colon cancer. Exercise\\nand a low fat diet help control weight and reduce the risk\\nof endometrial, breast, and colon cancer.\\nCertain drugs, which are currently being used for\\ntreatment, could also be suitable for prevention. For\\nexample, the drug tamoxifen (Nolvadex), which has been\\nvery effective against breast cancer, is currently being\\ntested by the National Cancer Institute for its ability to\\nprevent cancer. Similarly, retinoids derived from vitamin\\nA are being tested for their ability to slow the progression\\nor prevent head and neck cancers. Certain studies have\\nsuggested that cancer incidence is lower in areas where\\nsoil and foods are rich in the mineral selenium. More tri-\\nals are needed to explain these intriguing connections.\\nPrognosis\\n“Lifetime risk” is the term that cancer researchers\\nuse to refer to the probability that an individual over the\\ncourse of a lifetime will develop cancer or die from it. In\\nthe United States, men have a one in two lifetime risk of\\ndeveloping cancer, and for women the risk is one in\\nthree. Overall, African-Americans are more likely to\\ndevelop cancer than whites. African-Americans are also\\n30% more likely to die of cancer than whites.\\nMost cancers are curable if detected and treated at\\ntheir early stages. A cancer patient’s prognosis is affected\\nby many factors, particularly the type of cancer the\\npatient has, the stage of the cancer, the extent to which it\\nhas metastasized and the aggressiveness of the cancer. In\\naddition, the patient’s age, general health status and the\\neffectiveness of the treatment being pursued are also\\nimportant factors.\\nTo help predict the future course and outcome of the\\ndisease and the likelihood of recovery from the disease,\\ndoctors often use statistics. The five-year survival rates\\nare the most common measures used. The number refers\\nto the proportion of people with cancer who are expected\\nto be alive, five years after initial diagnosis, comparedwith a similar population that is free of cancer. It is\\nimportant to note that while statistics can give some\\ninformation about the average survival experience of\\ncancer patients in a given population, it cannot be used to\\nindicate individual prognosis, because no two patients\\nare exactly alike.\\nPrevention\\nAccording to nutritionists and epidemiologists from\\nleading universities in the United States, a person can\\nreduce the chances of getting cancer by following some\\nsimple guidelines:\\n• eating plenty of vegetables and fruits\\n• exercising vigorously for at least 20 minutes every day\\n• avoiding excessive weight gain\\n• avoiding tobacco (even second hand smoke)\\n• decreasing or avoiding consumption of animal fats and\\nred meats\\n• avoiding excessive amounts of alcohol\\n• avoiding the midday sun (between 11 A.M. and 3 P.M.)\\nwhen the suns rays are the strongest\\n• avoiding risky sexual practices\\n• avoiding known carcinogens in the environment or\\nwork place\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 637Cancer\\nA transmission electron micrograph (TEM) of two spindle\\ncell nuclei from a human sarcoma.

Usually when cancer cells grow\\nthey manage to derive a blood supply that allows passage\\nof nutrients promoting continuation of abnormal cancer\\ngrowth. Research that focuses on destroying these blood\\nvessels is called angiogenesis. Cutting off the blood sup-\\nply has been shown to destroy tumors, since this stops\\nthe flow of essential nutrients required for cancer growth.\\nUse of certain growth factors can also stimulate self-\\ndestructive pathways in cancer cells (apoptosis). Gene\\ntherapy is directed towards inhibiting specific cellular\\nsignals that promote cancer cell multiplication.\\nPrecautions\\nSurgical resection requires an experienced surgeon,\\npreoperative assessment, imaging studies, and delicate\\noperative technique. Care should be taken during the pro-\\ncedure to avoid unnecessary tumor manipulation, which\\ncan cause cancer cells to infiltrate adjacent structures. If\\nmanipulation is excessive, cells can enter nearby areas\\nfor future re-growth. Accurate isolation of the tumor can\\nalso help to avoid contamination of the surgical area.\\nEarly ligation of the blood supply to the tumor is an\\nessential component of a surgical cure.\\nRadiotherapy requires extensive treatment planning\\nand imaging. Care must be taken to localize the cancer\\nfield while attempting to spare destruction of normal tis-\\nsue. This requires image monitoring and exact position-\\ning during radiation treatment sessions.\\nChemotherapy usually causes destruction of normal\\ncells, and cancer cells can become immune to chemical\\ndestruction. Side effects and patient tolerance issues are\\ntypically anticipated and dosages may have to be specifi-\\ncally altered. Very few chemotherapeutic agents offer\\ncurative responses.\\nBiological therapies may cause patient toxicity\\nresulting in extensive side effects. This can occur sincethe optimal dose may be exceedingly elevated above\\npatient tolerance.\\nDescription\\nSurgery\\nSurgical removal of the tumor must be performed with\\ncare and accuracy. The surgeon must avoid over manipula-\\ntion of the surgical field. Too much movement within the\\narea can cause cancer cell displacement into surrounding\\ntissue. If this occurs and no further treatment is indicated,\\nthe tumor may grow again. The surgeon should also per-\\nform an assessment concerning tissue removal around the\\ncancer site. Tissue around the site may not by inspection\\nseem cancerous, but adjacent structures may have cancer\\ncells and surrounding tissue removal is usually part of the\\noperative procedure. Pieces of tumor and the surrounding\\narea are analyzed microscopically during the operation for\\ncell type. An adequate resection (removal of tissue) will\\nreveal normal cells in the specimens analyzed from areas\\nbordering the cancerous growth. Surgery can also help to\\ndecrease the tumor bulk and, along with other treatment\\nmeasures, may provide a cure for certain cancers.\\nNot only can surgery be curative for some cancers,\\nbut it is an essential diagnostic tool that must be assessed\\nintraoperatively since microscopic analysis will guide\\nthe surgeon concerning tumor and surrounding tissue\\nremoval. These diagnostic procedures include an aspira-\\ntion biopsy, which inserts a needle to extract (aspirate)\\nfluid contained inside a cancerous growth; a needle biop-\\nsy uses a specialized needle to obtain a core tissue speci-\\nmen; an incision biopsy removes a section from a large\\ntumor; and an excision biopsy removes the entire tumor.\\nThe surgeon can also take samples of neighboring lymph\\nnodes. Cancer in surrounding lymph nodes is an impor-\\ntant avenue for distant spread of cancer to other areas. If\\nmicroscopic analysis determines the presence of cancer\\ncells in lymph nodes then the surgeon may decide to per-\\nform a more aggressive surgical approach.\\nRadiation therapy\\nSimilar to surgical intervention, radiotherapy is a\\nlocalized treatment. It involves the administration of ion-\\nizing radiation to a solid tumor location. This generates\\nreactive oxygen molecules, causing the destruction of\\nDNA in local cells. There are three commonly used\\nradiotherapy beams: gamma rays from a linear accelera-\\ntor machine produce a focused beam; orthovoltage rays\\nare of less energy, thus penetrate less and typically deliv-\\ner higher doses to superficial tissues (efficient for treat-\\ning skin cancers); and megavoltage rays are high energy\\nproducing beams and can penetrate deeply situated inter-\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 639Cancer therapy, definitive'),\n",

Two\\ncommon routes can deliver radiation. Brachytherapy\\ndelivers radiation to a local area by placing radioactive\\nmaterials within close proximity to the cancerous site.\\nTeletherapy delivers radiation to a specific area using an\\nexternal beam machine.\\nChemotherapy\\nCurative chemotherapy usually requires multiple\\nadministrations of the chemical agent. Chemotherapy or\\nsystemic therapy is administered in the blood and circu-\\nlates through the entire body. The choice of chemothera-\\npeutic agents depends on the specific type of cancer.\\nChemotherapy is more commonly used for metastatic\\n(malignant cancer which has spread to other areas\\nbeyond the primary site of cancer growth) disease, since\\nvery few cancers are cured by systemic therapy.\\nBiologic therapy\\nBiologic therapies primarily function to alter the\\npatient’s response to cancer. These treatments are mostly\\ninvestigations and there are numerous research protocols\\nstudying the effects of biologic treatments. These proto-\\ncols usually have strict admission criteria that may\\nexclude potential candidates who can benefit from treat-\\nment. These treatments tend to stimulate specific immune\\ncells or immune chemicals to destroy cancer cells.\\nPreparation\\nFor all treatment modalities imaging studies, biopsy,\\nand constant blood analysis is essential before, during,\\nand after treatments. Surgical candidates should undergo\\nextensive pre-operative evaluation with imaging studies,\\nblood chemistry analysis, stabilized health status, and\\nreadiness of staff for any potential complications and cell\\nbiopsy analysis. Patients with other pre-existing chronic\\ndisease may require intensive post-operative monitoring.\\nFor radiotherapy, the patient undergoes extensive imag-\\ning studies. Additional planning strategies include beamKEY TERMS\\nBone marrow suppression —A decrease in cells\\nresponsible for providing immunity, carrying oxygen\\nand those responsible for normal blood clotting.\\nDNA —The molecule responsible for cell multipli-\\ncation.\\nTitrate —To analyze the best end point (for dose)\\nfor a medication.localization to spare normal tissues, calibration of fractionat-\\ned doses, and specific positioning during treatment sessions.\\nPatients who receive curative chemotherapy should\\nbe informed of possible side effects associated with the\\nchemotherapeutic agent. Patients should also be informed\\nof temporary lifestyle changes and medications that may\\noffer some symptomatic relief.\\nPatients undergoing biologic therapies are usually\\nadvised of potential side effects, treatment cycles and\\nspecific tests for monitoring progress according to the\\nspecific research protocol.\\nAftercare\\nPatients will typically be evaluated by imaging stud-\\nies, blood analysis, physical examination , and health\\nimprovement. These follow-up visits usually occur at spe-\\ncific time intervals during the course of treatment. Surgi-\\ncal patients may require closer observation during the ini-\\ntial post-operative period to avoid potential complica-\\ntions. Reconstructive surgery can be considered to\\nimprove appearance and restore function. Certain surgical\\nprocedures (such as flaps and microsurgery of blood ves-\\nsels) can restore new tissues to a previous surgery site.\\nRisks\\nSurgical risks\\nSurgical therapy can be both disfiguring and dis-\\nabling. Many normal tissues can be adversely affected\\nby radiotherapy.

The primary objective of palliative care is\\nto improve the quality of remaining duration of life.\\nTreatment usually involves a combination of modalities\\n(multimodality approach) and numerous specialists are\\ntypically involved in the treatment planning process.\\nTherapeutic planning usually involves meticulous coor-\\ndination with the treatment team.\\nSurgery can be utilized for palliation after careful\\nevaluation and planning. The use of surgery in these cases\\nmay reduce the tumor bulk and help improve the quality of\\nlife by relieving pain , alleviating obstruction, or control-\\nling bleeding. Radiotherapy for terminal cancer patientscan also alleviate pain, bleeding, and obstruction of neigh-\\nboring areas. Chemotherapy may be helpful to reduce\\ntumor size and provide some reduction to metastatic dis-\\nease. Long-term chemotherapy patients develop drug\\nresistance, a situation that renders chemotherapeutic treat-\\nments ineffective. If this occurs patients are usually given\\na second line medication or, if admission criteria are met,\\nthey may participate in an experimental research protocol.\\nPalliative treatments and terminal cancer in combination\\ncan cause many symptoms that can become problematic.\\nThese symptoms commonly include pain, nausea, vomit-\\ning, difficulty in breathing, constipation , dehydration,\\nagitation, and delirium . The palliative treatment-planning\\ngoal focuses to reduce these symptoms.\\nPrecautions\\nSurgery for the purpose of tumor removal , biopsy, or\\nsize reduction is associated with postoperative pain and\\nlocal nerve damage, which may be both severe and difficult\\nto alleviate. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy can also\\nproduce nerve damage and severe pain. Additionally,\\npatients with malignant cancer are susceptible to infections\\nlike herpes, pneumonia , urinary tract infections, and\\nwound abscess , all of which can cause severe pain. Pain\\nassociated with cancer and/or treatments can significantly\\nimpair the patient’s capabilities for performing daily tasks\\nand hence impair quality of life. These complications may\\nnegatively impact the patient’s psychological well being.\\nDescription\\nPain is one of the common symptoms associated with\\ncancer. Approximately 75% of terminal cancer patients\\nhave pain. Pain is a subjective symptom and thus it cannot\\nbe measured using technological approaches. Pain can be\\nassessed using numeric scales (from one to 10, one is rated\\nas no pain while 10 is severe) or rating specific facial\\nexpressions associated with various levels of pain. The\\nmajority of cancer patients experience pain as a result of\\ntumor mass that compresses neighboring nerves, bone, or\\nsoft tissues, or from direct nerve injury (neuropathic pain).\\nPain can occur from affected nerves in the ribs, muscles,\\nand internal structures such as the abdomen (cramping\\ntype pain associated with obstruction). Many patients also\\nexperience various types of pain as a direct result of fol-\\nlow-up tests, treatments (surgery, radiation, and chemo-\\ntherapy) and diagnostic procedures (i.e., biopsy).\\nPreparation\\nPatients are typically informed that their diagnosis is\\nterminal and treatments are directed to improve quality\\nof life for the remaining time and to minimize emotional\\nsuffering associated with pain.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 641Cancer therapy, palliative'),\n",

A physical examination may ver-\\nify the presence of pain. Imaging analysis may further con-\\nfirm the presence of potential causes of pain. The World\\nHealth Organization (WHO) recommends an analgesic lad-\\nder. This treatment approach provides medication selec-\\ntions based on previous analgesic use and severity of pain.\\nThe ladder starts with the use of non-opioid (non-mor-\\nphine) drugs such as aspirin , acetaminophin, or non-\\nsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications for control of mild\\npain. Chronic pain must be treated with constant and con-\\nsistently administered medication(s). The “take as needed”\\napproach is not advised. Supplemental doses may be rec-\\nommended in addition to the standard dose for circum-\\nstances that may worsen pain. Opioids (i.e., morphine and\\ncodeine) are the medications of choice for moderate to\\nsevere pain. Doses are adjusted to produce maximum pain\\nrelief while minimizing side effects.

Canker sores appear as a\\nwhitish, round area with a red border. The sores are\\npainful and sensitive to touch. The average canker sore is\\nabout one-quarter inch in size, although they can occa-\\nsionally be larger. Canker sores are not infectious.\\nApproximately 20% of the U.S. population is affect-\\ned with recurring canker sores, and more women than\\nmen get them. Women are more likely to have canker\\nsores during their premenstrual period.\\nCanker sores are sometimes confused with cold\\nsores. Cold sores are caused by herpes simplex virus.\\nThis disease, also known as oral herpes or fever blisters,\\ncan occur anywhere on the body. Most commonly, her-\\npes infection occurs on the outside of the lips and the\\ngums, and much less frequently on the inside the mouth.\\nCold sores are infectious.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nThe exact cause of canker sores is uncertain, howev-\\ner, they seem to be related to a localized immune reac-\\ntion. Other proposed causes for this disease are trauma to\\nthe affected areas from toothbrush scrapes, stress , hor-\\nmones, and food allergies . Canker sores tend to appear\\nin response to stress. The initial symptom is a tingling or\\nmildly painful itching sensation in the area where the\\nsore will appear. After one to several days, a small red\\nswelling appears. The sore is round, and is a whitish\\ncolor with a grayish colored center. Usually, there is a red\\nring of inflammation surrounding the sore. The main\\nsymptom is pain . Canker sores can be very painful, espe-\\ncially if they are touched repeatedly, e.g., by the tongue.\\nThey last for one to two weeks.KEY TERMS\\nInflammation —A local reaction to tissue injury or\\ndamage, usually characterized by pain, swelling,\\nand redness.\\nSore—A wound, lesion, or ulcer on the skin.\\nUlcer —A site of damage to the skin or mucous\\nmembrane that is characterized by the formation\\nof pus, death of tissue, and is frequently accompa-\\nnied by an inflammatory reaction.Diagnosis\\nCanker sores are diagnosed by observation of the\\nblister. A distinction between canker sores and cold sores\\nmust be made because cold sores are infectious and the\\nherpes infection can be transmitted to other people. The\\ntwo sores can usually be distinguished visually and there\\nare specific diagnostic tests for herpes infection.\\nTreatment\\nSince canker sores heal by themselves, treatment is\\nnot usually necessary. Pain relief remedies, such as topi-\\ncal anesthetics, may be used to reduce the pain of the\\nsores. The use of corticosteroid ointments sometimes\\nspeeds healing. Avoidance of spicy or acidic foods can\\nhelp reduce the pain associated with canker sores.\\nAlternative treatment\\nAlternative therapies for canker sores are aimed at\\nhealing existing sores and preventing their recurrence.\\nSeveral herbal remedies, including calendula ( Calendula\\nofficinalis ), myrrh ( Commiphora molmol ), and gold-\\nenseal ( Hydrastis canadensis ), may be helpful in the\\ntreatment of existing sores.

Lactose intolerance , the\\ninability to digest the sugar found in milk, is widespread\\nand affects up to 70% of the world’s adult population.\\nDescription\\nCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy and,\\nalong with fats and proteins, one of the three major nutri-\\nents in the human diet. Carbohydrates are classified\\naccording to their structure based on the number of basic\\nsugar, or saccharide units they contain.\\nA monosaccharide is the simplest carbohydrate and\\ncalled a simple sugar. Simple sugars include glucose (the\\nform in which sugar circulates in the blood), fructose\\n(found in fruit and honey), and galactose (produced by\\nthe digestion of milk). These simple sugars are important\\nbecause they can be absorbed by the small intestine. Two\\nsimple sugars linked together make a disaccharide. The\\ndisaccharide sugars present in the diet are maltose (a\\nproduct of the digestion of starch), sucrose (table sugar),\\nand lactose (the sugar in milk). These disaccharides must\\nbe broken down by enzymes into two simple sugars so\\nthat they can be absorbed by the intestine. Polysaccha-\\nrides are much more complex carbohydrates made up of\\nmany simple sugars, the most important of which are\\nglycogen, which is stored in the liver, and starch.\\nDigestion of sugars\\nDigestion of food begins in the mouth, moves on to\\nthe stomach, and then into the small intestine. Along the\\nway, specific enzymes are needed to process different\\ntypes of sugars. An enzyme is a substance that acts as a\\ncatalyst to produce chemical changes without being\\nchanged itself. The enzymes lactase, maltase, and isoma-\\nltase (or sucrase) are needed to break down the disaccha-\\nrides; when one or more is inadequate, the result is car-\\nbohydrate intolerance.\\nTypes of intolerance\\nCarbohydrate intolerance can be primary or sec-\\nondary. Primary deficiency is caused by an enzyme defect\\npresent at birth or developed over time. The most common\\nis lactose intolerance. Secondary deficiencies are caused\\nby a disease or disorder of the intestinal tract, and disap-pear when the disease is treated. These include protein\\ndeficiency, celiac disease , and some intestinal infections.\\nAdult lactose intolerance is the most common of all\\nenzyme deficiencies, and it is estimated that 30–50 mil-\\nlion Americans have this condition. Some racial and eth-\\nnic populations are affected more than others. Lactose\\nintolerance is found in as many as 75% of African Ameri-\\ncans, Jewish Americans, Mexican Americans, and Native\\nAmericans, and in 90% of Asian Americans. Descendants\\nof Northern Europeans and some Mediterranean peoples\\nusually do not develop the condition. Deficiencies in\\nenzymes other than lactase are extremely rare.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nEnzymes play an important role in breaking down\\ncarbohydrates into forms that can pass through the intes-\\ntine and be used by the body. Usually they are named by\\nadding aseto the name of the substance they act on, so\\nlactase is the enzyme needed to process lactose. Cooked\\nstarch is broken down in the mouth to a disaccharide by\\namylase, an enzyme in the saliva. The disaccharides mal-\\ntose, sucrose, and lactose cannot be absorbed until they\\nhave been separated into simple sugar molecules by their\\ncorresponding enzymes present in the cells lining the\\nintestinal tract. If this process is not completed, digestion\\nis interrupted.\\nAlthough not common, a deficiency in the enzymes\\nneeded to digest lactose, maltose, and sucrose is some-\\ntimes present at birth. Intestinal lactase enzymes usually\\ndecrease naturally with age, but this happens to varying\\ndegrees. Because of the uneven distribution of enzyme\\ndeficiency based on race and ethnic heritage, especially\\nin lactose intolerance, genetics are believed to play a role\\nin the cause of primary carbohydrate intolerance.\\nDigestive diseases such as celiac disease and tropi-\\ncal sprue (which affect absorption in the intestine), as\\nwell as intestinal infections and injuries, can reduce the\\namount of enzymes produced. In cancer patients, treat-\\nment with radiation therapy or chemotherapy may\\naffect the cells in the intestine that normally secrete lac-\\ntase, leading to intolerance.\\nThe severity of the symptoms depends on the extent\\nof the enzyme deficiency, and range from a feeling of\\nmild bloating to severe diarrhea . In the case of a lactase\\ndeficiency, undigested milk sugar remains in the intes-\\ntine, which is then fermented by the bacteria normally\\npresent in the intestine. These bacteria produce gas,\\ncramping, bloating, a “gurgly” feeling in the abdomen,\\nand flatulence. In a growing child, the main symptoms\\nare diarrhea and a failure to gain weight.

In primary conditions, no treatment\\nexists to improve the body’s ability to produce the\\nenzymes, but symptoms can be controlled by diet.\\nBecause the degree of lactose intolerance varies so\\nmuch, treatment should be tailored for the individual.\\nYoung children showing signs of intolerance should\\navoid milk products; infants should switch to soy-based\\nformula. Older children and adults can adjust their intake\\nof lactose depending on how much and what they can\\ntolerate. For some, a small glass of milk will not cause\\nproblems, while others may be able to handle ice cream\\nor aged cheeses such as cheddar or Swiss, but not other\\ndairy products.

CO is a colorless, odorless,\\nhighly poisonous gas that is produced by incomplete\\ncombustion. It is found in automobile exhaust fumes,\\nfaulty stoves and heating systems, fires, and cigarette\\nsmoke. Other sources include woodburning stoves,\\nkerosene heaters, improperly ventilated water heaters\\nand gas stoves, and blocked or poorly maintained chim-\\nney flues. CO interferes with the ability of the blood to\\ncarry oxygen. The result is headache , nausea, convul-\\nsions, and finally death by asphyxiation.\\nDescription\\nCarbon monoxide, sometimes called coal gas, has\\nbeen known as a toxic substance since the third century\\nB.C. It was used for executions and suicides in early Rome.\\nToday it is the leading cause of accidental poisoning in the\\nUnited States. According to the Journal of the American\\nMedical Association , 1,500 Americans die each year from\\naccidental exposure to CO, and another 2,300 from inten-\\ntional exposure (suicide). An additional 10,000 people\\nseek medical attention after exposure to CO and recover.Anyone who is exposed to CO will become sick, and\\nthe entire body is involved in CO poisoning. A develop-\\ning fetus can also be poisoned if a pregnant woman\\nbreathes CO gas. Infants, people with heart or lung dis-\\nease, or those with anemia may be more seriously affect-\\ned. People such as underground parking garage atten-\\ndants who are exposed to car exhausts in a confined area\\nare more likely to be poisoned by CO. Firemen also run a\\nhigher risk of inhaling CO.\\nCauses and symptoms\\nNormally when a person breathes fresh air into the\\nlungs, the oxygen in the air binds with a molecule called\\nhemoglobin (Hb) that is found in red blood cells. This\\nallows oxygen to be moved from the lungs to every part\\nof the body. When the oxygen/hemoglobin complex\\nreaches a muscle where it is needed, the oxygen is\\nreleased. Because the oxygen binding process is\\nreversible, hemoglobin can be used over and over again\\nto pick up oxygen and move it throughout the body.\\nInhaling carbon monoxide gas interferes with this\\noxygen transport system. In the lungs, CO competes with\\noxygen to bind with the hemoglobin molecule. Hemo-\\nglobin prefers CO to oxygen and accepts it more than\\n200 times more readily than it accepts oxygen. Not only\\ndoes the hemoglobin prefer CO, it holds on to the CO\\nmuch more tightly, forming a complex called carboxyhe-\\nmoglobin (COHb). As a person breathes CO contaminat-\\ned air, more and more oxygen transportation sites on the\\nhemoglobin molecules become blocked by CO. Gradual-\\nly, there are fewer and fewer sites available for oxygen.\\nAll cells need oxygen to live. When they don’t get\\nenough oxygen, cellular metabolism is disrupted and\\neventually cells begin to die.\\nThe symptoms of CO poisoning and the speed with\\nwhich they appear depend on the concentration of CO in\\nthe air and the rate and efficiency with which a person\\nbreathes. Heavy smokers can start off with up to 9% of\\ntheir hemoglobin already bound to CO, which they regu-\\nlarly inhale in cigarette smoke. This makes them much\\nmore susceptible to environmental CO. The Occupation-\\nal Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has estab-\\nlished a maximum permissible exposure level of 50 parts\\nper million (ppm) over eight hours.\\nWith exposure to 200 ppm for two to three hours, a\\nperson begins to experience headache, fatigue , nausea,\\nand dizziness . These symptoms correspond to 15–25%\\nCOHb in the blood. When the concentration of COHb\\nreaches 50% or more, death results in a very short time.\\nEmergency room physicians have the most experience\\ndiagnosing and treating CO poisoning.\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 651Carbon monoxide poisoning'),\n",

CEA is a substance which is normally\\nfound only during fetal development, but may reappear\\nin adults who develop certain types of cancer .\\nPurpose\\nThe CEA test is ordered for patients with known\\ncancers. The CEA test is most commonly ordered when a\\npatient has a cancer of the gastrointestinal system. These\\ninclude cancer of the colon, rectum, stomach (gastric\\ncancer), esophagus, liver, or pancreas. It is also used with\\ncancers of the breast, lung, or prostate.\\nThe CEA level in the blood is one of the factors that\\ndoctors consider when determining the prognosis, or\\nmost likely outcome of a cancer. In general, a higher\\nCEA level predicts a more severe disease, one that is less\\nlikely to be curable. But it does not give clear-cut infor-\\nmation. The results of a CEA test are usually considered\\nalong with other laboratory and/or imaging studies to fol-\\nlow the course of the disease.\\nOnce treatment for the cancer has begun, CEA tests\\nhave a valuable role in monitoring the patient’s progress.\\nA decreasing CEA level means therapy is effective in\\nfighting the cancer. A stable or increasing CEA level may\\nmean the treatment is not working, and/or that the tumor\\nis growing. It is important to understand that serial CEA\\nmeasurements, which means several done over a period\\nof time, are the most useful. A single test result is diffi-\\ncult to evaluate, but a number of tests, done weeks apart,\\nshows trends in disease progression or regression.\\nCertain types of cancer treatments, such as hormone\\ntherapy for breast cancer , may actually cause the CEA\\nlevel to go up. This elevation does not accurately reflect\\nthe state of the disease.

Left-sided heart catheterization is\\nperformed by way of a catheter through an artery which\\ntests the blood flow of the coronary arteries, function of\\nthe mitral and aortic valves, and left ventricle.\\nPurpose\\nThe primary reason for conducting a cardiac\\ncatheterization is to diagnose and manage persons known\\nor suspected to have heart disease, a frequently fatal con-\\ndition that leads to 1.5 million heart attacks annually in\\nthe United States.\\nSymptoms and diagnoses that may lead to perform-\\ning this procedure include:\\n• chest pain , characterized by prolonged heavy pressure\\nor a squeezing pain\\n• abnormal treadmill stress test\\n• myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack\\n• congenital heart defects, or heart problems that origi-\\nnated from birth\\n• a diagnosis of valvular-heart disease\\n• a need to measure the heart muscle’s ability to pump\\nblood\\nTypically performed along with angiography , a tech-\\nnique of injecting a dye into the vascular system to outline\\nthe heart and blood vessels, a catheterization can aid in the\\nvisualization of any blockages, narrowing, or abnormalities\\nin the coronary arteries. If these signs are visible, the cardi-\\nologist may assess the patient’s need and readiness for\\ncoronary bypass surgery, or perhaps a less invasive\\napproach, such as dilation of a narrowed blood vessel either\\nsurgically or with the use of a balloon ( angioplasty ).\\nWhen looking at the left side of the heart, fluoro-\\nscopic guidance also allows the following diagnoses to\\nbe assessed:\\n• enlargement of the left ventricle\\n• ventricular aneurysms (abnormal dilation of a blood\\nvessel)\\n• narrowing of the aortic valve\\n• insufficiency of the aortic or mitral valve\\n• the detour of blood from one side of the heart to the\\nother due to septal defects (also known as shunting)\\nPrecautions\\nCardiac catheterization is categorized as an “inva-\\nsive” procedure which involves the heart, its valves, andcoronary arteries, in addition to a large artery in the arm\\nor leg. Due to the nature of the test, it is important to\\nevaluate for the following conditions before considering\\nthis procedure:\\n• A diagnosis of a bleeding disorder, poor kidney func-\\ntion, or debilitation. Any of these pre-existing condi-\\ntions typically raises the risk of the catheterization pro-\\ncedure and may be reason to cancel the procedure.\\n• A diagnosis of heart valve disease. If this is detected,\\nantibiotics may be given before the test to prevent\\ninflammation of the membrane which lines the heart\\n(endocarditis).\\nDescription\\nTo understand how a cardiac catheterization is able\\nto diagnose and manage heart disease, the basic work-\\nings of the heart muscle must also be understood. Just as\\nthe body relies on a constant supply of blood to aid in its\\neveryday functions, so does the heart. The heart is made\\nup of an intricate web of blood vessels (coronary arter-\\nies) that ensure an adequate supply of blood rich in oxy-\\ngen and nutrients. It is easy to see how an abnormality in\\nany of these arteries can be detrimental to the heart’s\\nfunction. These abnormalities cause the heart’s blood\\nflow to decrease and result in the condition known as\\ncoronary artery disease or coronary insufficiency.\\nCatheterization is a valuable tool in detecting and\\ntreating abnormalities of the heart. Through the use of\\nfluoroscopic (x ray) guidance, a catheter, which may\\nresemble a balloon-tipped tube, is strung through the\\nveins or arteries into the heart, so the cardiologist can\\nmonitor a body’s various functions at each moment.\\nGenerally a test that lasts two to three hours, a\\npatient should expect the following prior to and during\\nthe catheterization procedure:\\n• A mild sedative may be given that will allow the patient\\nto relax but remain conscious during the test.\\n• An intravenous needle will be inserted in the arm to\\nadminister medication. Electrodes will be attached to\\nthe chest to enable the painless procedure known as an\\nelectrocardiograph.\\n• Prior to inserting a catheter into an artery or vein in the\\narm or leg, the incision site will be made numb by\\ninjecting a local anesthetic. When the anesthetic is\\ninjected it may feel like a pin-prick followed by a quick\\nstinging sensation. Pressure may also be experienced as\\nthe catheter travels through the blood vessel.\\n• After the catheter is guided into the coronary-artery\\nsystem, a dye (also called a radiocontrast material) is\\ninjected to aid in the identification of any abnormalities\\nGALE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MEDICINE 2 656Cardiac catheterization'),\n",

During this time, the patient may experi-\\nence a hot, flushed feeling or a quickly passing nausea.\\nCoughing or breathing deeply aids in any discomfort.\\n• Medication may be given during the procedure if chest\\npain is experienced, and nitroglycerin may also be admin-\\nistered to allow expansion of the heart’s blood vessels.\\n• When the test is complete, the physician will remove the\\ncatheter and close the skin with several sutures or tape.\\nPreparation\\nPrior to the cardiac catheterization procedure, it is\\nimportant to relay information to the physician or nurse\\nregarding allergies to shellfish (such as shrimp or scal-\\nlops) which contain iodine, iodine itself, or the dyes that\\nare commonly used in other diagnostic tests.\\nBecause this procedure is categorized as a surgery, the\\npatient will be instructed not to eat or drink anything for at\\nleast six hours prior to the test. Just before the test begins,\\nthe patient will urinate and change into a hospital gown,\\nthen lie flat on a padded table that may also be tilted in\\norder for the heart to be examined from a variety of angles.\\nAftercare\\nWhile cardiac catheterization may be performed on\\nan outpatient basis, a patient may require close monitor-\\ning following the procedure while remaining in the hos-\\npital for at least 24 hours. The patient will be instructed\\nto rest in bed for at least eight hours immediately after\\nthe test. If the catheter was inserted into a vein or artery\\nin the leg or groin area, the leg will be kept extended for\\nfour to six hours. If a vein or artery in the arm was used\\nto insert the catheter, the arm will need to remain extend-\\ned for a minimum of three hours.\\nThe patient should expect a hard ridge to form over\\nthe incision site that diminishes as the site heals. Bluish\\ndiscoloration under the skin at the point of insertion\\nshould also be expected but fades in two weeks. It is also\\nnot uncommon for the incision site to bleed during the\\nfirst 24 hours following surgery. If this should happen,\\nthe patient should apply pressure to the site with a clean\\ntissue or cloth for 10–15 minutes.\\nRisks\\nSimilar to all surgical procedures, the cardiac\\ncatheterization test does involve some risks. Complica-\\ntions that may occur during the procedure include\\n• cardiac arrhythmias (an irregular heart beat)\\n• pericardial tamponade (a condition that causes excess\\npressure in the pericardium which affects the heart due\\nto accumulation of excess fluid)• the rare occurrence of myocardial infarction (heart\\nattack) or stroke may also develop due to clotting or\\nplaque rupture of one or more of the coronary or brain\\narteries.\\nBefore left-side catheterization is performed, the\\nanticoagulant medication heparin may be administered.\\nThis drug helps decrease the risk of the development of a\\nblood clot in an artery (thrombosis) and blood clots trav-\\neling throughout the body (embolization).\\nThe risks of the catheterization procedure increase\\nin patients over the age of 60, those who have severe\\nheart failure , or persons with serious valvular heart\\ndisease .\\nNormal results\\nNormal findings from a cardiac catheterization will\\nindicate no abnormalities of heart chamber size or con-\\nfiguration, wall motion or thickness, the direction of\\nblood flow, or motion of the valves.

Blunt or penetrating injury from\\ntrauma to the chest or heart can also result in cardiac tam-\\nponade when large amounts of blood fill the pericardium.\\nTamponade can also occur during heart surgery.\\nWhen the heart is compressed by the surrounding\\nfluid, three conditions occur: a reduced amount of blood\\nis pumped to the body by the heart, the lower chambers\\nof the ventricles are filled with a less than normal amount\\nof blood, and higher than normal blood pressures occur\\ninside the heart, caused by the pressure of the fluid push-\\ning in on the heart from the outside.\\nWhen tamponade occurs because of trauma, the\\nsound of the heart beats can become faint, and the blood\\npressure in the arteries decreases, while the blood pres-\\nsure in the veins increases.\\nIn cases of tamponade caused by more slowly devel-\\noping diseases, shortness of breath , a feeling of tight-\\nness in the chest, increased blood pressure in the large\\nveins in the neck (the jugular veins), weight gain, and\\nfluid retention by the body can occur.\\nDiagnosis\\nWhen cardiac tamponade is suspected, accurate diag-\\nnosis can be life-saving.
